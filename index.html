                    you need a place to stay, you should think about going to a shelter.</p>

                <p>
                    After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was
                    hit
                    again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone
                    underwater
                    again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary
                    shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases.
